# CS221FinalProject

This project is not run-able, due to some proprietary code that could not be included in the public repository. 

The main files are:

* topic_lm.py: contains the topic-integrated language modeling code. 
* train_topic_lm.py: interface for fine-tuning and sampling from the topic-integrated language model.
